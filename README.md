### Basis

Running rough statistical analysis on automated social media campaigns (read: bot spam) following any
media event about the current US administration has revealed common threads 
all linked to a specific set of Russian technology companies and individuals. 

Often these campaigns attempt to 'signal boost' known far-right propaganda 
websites located in the US and EU, but are occasionally only innocuous seeming news headlines. Many
include identical postings but with links replaced with malicious websites also originating
from Russia.

Upon further research we found some of these companies and individuals were 
highlighted in the recent release of a dossier by a former MI6 agent which outlined
Russian influence and infiltration into a major US political campaign.

Finding these connections completely independently has inspired us to break out
the tin-foil hats and take another look.
