#### US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION: REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP'S
#### ACTIVITIES IN RUSSIA AND COMPROMISING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE
#### KREMLIN


#### Summary

Russian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years. 
Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance

So far TRUMP has declined various sweetener real estate business deals
offered him in Russia in order to further the Kremlin's cultivation of him.
However he and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of
intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals

Former top Russian intelligence officer claims FSB has compromised
TRUMP through his activities in Moscow sufficiently to be able to
blackmail him. According to several knowledgeable sources, his conduct
in Moscow has included perverted sexual acts which have been arranged/monitored by the FSB

A dossier of compromising material on Hillary CLINTON has been collated
by the Russian Intelligence Services over many years and mainly
comprises bugged conversations she had on various visits to Russia and
intercepted phone calls rather than any embarrassing conduct. The
dossier is controlled by Kremlin spokesman, PESKOV, directly on 
orders. However it has not as yet been distributed abroad, including to TRUMP. 
Russian intentions for its deployment still unclear

#### Detail

Speaking to a trusted compatriot in June 2016 sources A and B, a senior
Russian Foreign Ministry figure and a former top level Russian
intelligence officer still active inside the Kremlin respectively, the Russian
authorities had been cultivating and supporting US Republican
presidential candidate, Donald TRUMP for at least 5 years. Source 
asserted that the TRUMP operation was both supported and directed by
Russian President Vladimir PUTIN. Its aim was to sow discord and


###### PAGE 2, 20 June 2016

disunity both within the US itself, but more especially Within the
Transatlantic alliance which was Viewed as inimical to Russia's interests.
Source C, a senior Russian financial official said the TRUMP operation
should be seen in terms of PUTIN's desire to return to Nineteenth
Century 'Great Power' politics anchored upon countries' interests rather
than the ideals-based international order established after World War
Two. S/he had overheard PUTIN talking in this way to close associates on 
several occasions.

In terms of specifics, Source A confided that the Kremlin had been feeding
TRUMP and his team valuable intelligence on his opponents, including
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary CLINTON, for several years
(see more below). This was confirmed by Source D, a close associate of
TRUMP who had organized and managed his recent trips to Moscow, and
who reported, also in June 2016, that this Russian intelligence had been
"very helpful". The Kremlin's cultivation operation on TRUMP also had
comprised offering him various lucrative real estate development
business deals in Russia, especially in relation to the ongoing 2018 World
Cup soccer tournament, However, so far, for reasons unknown, TRUMP had not 
taken up any of these.

However, there were other aspects to TRUMP's engagement with the
Russian authorities. One which had borne fruit for them was to exploit
personal TRUMP's obsessions and sexual perversion in order to obtain
suitable 'kompromat' (compromising material) on him. According to
Source D, where s/he had been present, TRUMP's (perverted) conduct in
Moscow included hiring the presidential suite of the Ritz Carlton Hotel,
where he knew President and  Mrs OBAMA (whom he hated) had stayed
on one of their official trips to Russia, and defiling the bed where they had
slept by employing a number of prostitutes to perform a 'golden showers'
(urination) show in front of him. The hotel was known to be under FSB
control with microphones and concealed cameras in all the main rooms
to record anything they wanted to.

The Moscow Ritz Carlton episode involving TRUMP reported above was
confirmed by Source E, [redacted], who said that s/he and several of the staff
were aware of it at the time and subsequently. S/he believed it had happened in 2013. 
Source E provided an introduction for a company ethnic Russian operative to
Source F, a female staffer at the hotel when TRUMP had stayed there, who
also confirmed the story. Speaking separately in June 2016, Source B (the
former top level Russian intelligence officer) asserted that TRUMP's 
unorthodox behavior in Russia over the years had provided the
authorities there with enough embarrassing material on the now
Republican presidential candidate to be able to blackmail him if they so
wished.

Asked about the Kremlin's reported intelligence feed to TRUMP over
recent years and rumours about a Russian dossier of'kompromat' on


###### PAGE 3, 20 June 2016


Hillary CLINTON (being circulated), Source B confirmed the file's
existence. S/he confided in a trusted compatriot that it had been collated
by Department K of the FSB for many years, dating back to her husband
Bill's presidency, and comprised mainly eavesdropped conversations of
various sorts rather than details/evidence of unorthodox or
embarrassing behavior. Some of the conversations were from bugged
comments CLINTON had made on her various trips to Russia and focused
on things she had said which contradicted her current position on various
issues. Others were most probably from phone intercepts.

Continuing on this theme, Source G, a senior Kremlin official, confided
that the CLINTON dossier was controlled exclusively by chief Kremlin
spokesman, Dmitriy PESKOV, who was responsible for
compiling/handling it on the explicit instructions of PUTIN himself. The
dossier however had not as yet been made available abroad, including to
TRUMP or his campaign team. At present it was unclear what PUTIN's
intentions were in this regard.

#### RUSSIA/CYBER CRIME: A SYNOPSIS OF RUSSIAN STATE SPONSORED AND
#### OTHER CYBER OFFENSIVE (CRIMINAL) OPERATIONS


#### Summary

Russia has extensive programme of state-sponsored offensive cyber
operations. External targets include foreign governments and big
corporations, especially banks. FSB leads on cyber within Russian
apparatus. Limited success in attacking top foreign targets like G7
governments, security services and IFIs but much more on second tier
ones through IT back doors, using corporate and other visitors to Russia

FSB often uses coercion and blackmail to recruit most capable cyber
operatives in Russia into its state-sponsored programmes. Heavy use also,
both wittingly and unwittingly, of CIS emigres working in western
corporations and ethnic Russians employed by neighbouring
governments e.g. Latvia

Example cited of successful Russian cyber operation targeting senior
Western business visitor. Provided back door into important Western
institutions.

Example given of US citizen of Russian origin approached by FSB and
offered incentive of "investment" in his business when visiting Moscow.

Problems however for Russian authorities themselves in countering local
hackers and cyber criminals, operating outside state control. Central Bank
claims there were over 20 serious attacks on correspondent accounts
held by CBR in 2015, comprising Roubles several billion in fraud

Some details given of leading non-state Russian cyber criminal groups

#### Details

Speaking in June 2016, a number of Russian figures with a detailed
knowledge of national cyber crime, both state-sponsored and otherwise,
outlined the current situation in this area. A former senior intelligence
officer divided Russian state-sponsored offensive cyber operations into
four categories (in order of priority):- targeting foreign, especially


###### PAGE 5, 26 JULY 2015


western governments; penetrating leading foreign business corporations,
especially banks; domestic monitoring of the elite; and attacking political
opponents both at home and abroad. The former intelligence officer
reported that the Federal Security Service (FSB) was the lead
organization within the Russian state apparatus for cyber operations.

In terms ofthe success of Russian offensive cyber operations to date, a
senior government figure reported that there had been only limited
success in penetrating the "first tier" foreign targets. These comprised
western (especially G7 and NATO) governments, security and intelligence
services and central banks, and the IFIs. To compensate for this shortfall,
massive effort had been invested, with much greater success, in attacking
the "secondary targets", particularly western private banks and the 
governments of smaller states allied to the West. S/he mentioned Latvia
in this regard. Hundreds of agents, either consciously cooperating with
the FSB or whose personal and professional IT systems had been
unwittingly compromised, were recruited. Many were people who had
ethnic and family ties to Russia and/or had been incentivized financially
to cooperate. Such people often would receive monetary inducements or
contractual favours from the Russian state or its agents in return. This
had created difficulties for parts of the Russian state apparatus in
obliging/indulging them e.g. the Central Bank of Russia knowingly having
to cover up for such agents' money laundering operations through the
Russian financial system.

In terms of the FSB's recruitment of capable cyber operatives to carry out
its, ideally deniable, offensive cyber operations, a Russian IT specialist
with direct knowledge reported in June 2016 that this was often done
using coercion and blackmail. In terms of 'foreign' agents, the FSB was
approaching US citizens of Russian (Jewish) origin on business trips to
Russia. In one case a US citizen of Russian ethnicity had been visiting
Moscow to attract investors in his new information technology program.
The FSB clearly knew this and had offered to provide seed capital to this
person in return for them being able to access and modify his IP, with a
view to targeting priority foreign targets by planting a Trojan virus in the
software. The US visitor was told this was common practice. The FSB also
had implied significant operational success as a result of installing cheap
Russian IT games containing their own malware unwittingly by targets
on their PCs and other platforms.

In a more advanced and successful FSB operation, an IT operator inside a
leading Russian SOE, who previously had been employed on conventional
(defensive) IT work there, had been under instruction for the last year to
conduct an offensive cyber operation against a foreign director of the
company. Although the latter was apparently an infrequent visitor to
Russia, the FSB now successfully had penetrated his personal IT and
through this had managed to access various important institutions in the
West through the back door.


###### PAGE 6, 26 JULY 2015


In terms of other technical IT platforms, an FSB cyber operative flagged
up the 'Telegram' enciphered commercial system as having been of
especial concern and therefore heavily targeted by the FSB, not least
because it was used frequently by Russian internal political activists and
oppositionists. His/her understanding was that the FSB now successfully
had cracked this communications software and therefore it was no longer
secure to use.

The senior Russian government figure cited above also reported that
non-state sponsored cyber crime was becoming an increasing problem
inside Russia for the government and authorities there. The Central Bank
of Russia claimed that in 2015 alone there had been more than 20
attempts at serious cyber embezzlement of money from corresponding
accounts held there, comprising several billions Roubles. More generally,
s/he understood there were circa 15 major organised crime groups in the
country involved in cyber crime, all of which continued to operate largely
outside state and FSB control. These included the so-called 'Anunak',
'Buktrap' and 'Metel' organisations.

#### PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION: FURTHER INDICATIONS OF
#### EXTENSIVE CONSPIRACY BETWEEN CAMPAIGN TEAM AND THE

#### KREMLIN

#### Summary

Further evidence of extensive conspiracy between campaign
team and Kremlin, sanctioned at highest levels and involving Russian
diplomatic staff based in the US

TRUMP associate admits Kremlin behind recent appearance of DNC e-
mails on WikiLeaks, as means of maintaining plausible deniability

Agreed exchange of information established in both directions. TRUMP's
team using moles within DNC and hackers in the US as well as outside in
Russia. PUTIN motivated by fear and hatred of Hillary CLINTON. Russians
receiving intel from TRUMP's team on Russian oligarchs and their families
in US

Mechanism for transmitting this intelligence involves "pension"
disbursements to Russian emigres living in US as cover, using consular
officials in New York, DC and Miami

Suggestion from source close to TRUMP and MANAFORT that Republican
campaign team happy to have Russia as media bogeyman to mask more
extensive corrupt business ties to China and other emerging countries

#### Detail

Speaking in confidence to a compatriot in late July 2016, Source E, an
ethnic Russian close associate of Republican US presidential candidate
Donald TRUMP, admitted that there was a well-developed conspiracy of
co-operation between them and the Russian leadership. This was
managed on the TRUMP side by the Republican candidate's campaign
manager, Paul MANAFORT, who was using foreign policy advisor, Carter
PAGE, and others as intermediaries. The two sides had a mutual interest
in defeating Democratic presidential candidate Hillary CLINTON, whom
President PUTIN apparently both hated and feared.

Inter alia, Source E, acknowledged that the Russian regime had been
behind the recent leak of embarrassing e-mail messages, emanating from
the Democratic National Committee (DNC), to the WikiLeaks platform.


###### PAGE 8


The reason for using WikiLeaks was "plausible deniability" and the
operation had been conducted with the full knowledge and support of
TRUMP and senior members of his campaign team. In return the TRUMP
team had agreed to sideline Russian intervention in Ukraine as a
campaign issue and to raise US/NATO defence commitments in the
Baltics and Eastern Europe to deflect attention away from Ukraine, a
priority for PUTIN who needed to cauterise the subject.

In the wider context of TRUMP campaign/Kremlin co-operation, Source E 
claimed that the intelligence network being used against CLINTON
comprised three elements. there were agents/facilitators within
the Democratic Party structure itself; secondly Russian emigre and
associated offensive cyber operators based in the US; and thirdly, state-
sponsored cyber operatives working in Russia. All three elements had
played an important role to date. On the mechanism for rewarding
relevant assets based in the US, and effecting a two-way flow of
intelligence and other useful information, Source E claimed that Russian
diplomatic staff in key cities such as New York, Washington DC and
Miami were using the emigre "pension" distribution system as cover. The
operation therefore depended on key people in the US Russian emigre
community for its success. Tens of thousands of dollars were involved.

In terms of the intelligence flow from the TRUMP team to Russia, Source E
reported that much of this concerned the activities of business
oligarchs and their families' activities and assets in the US, with which
PUTIN and the Kremlin seemed preoccupied.

Commenting on the negative media publicity surrounding alleged
Russian interference in the US election campaign in support of TRUMP,
Source E said he understood that the Republican candidate and his team
were relatively relaxed about this because it deflected media and the
Democrats' attention away from TRUMP's business dealings in China and
other emerging markets. Unlike in Russia, these were substantial and
involved the payment of large bribes and kickbacks which, were they to
become public, would be potentially very damaging to their campaign.

Finally, regarding TRUMP's claimed minimal investment profile in Russia,
a separate source with direct knowledge said this had not been for want
of trying. TRUMP's previous efforts had included exploring the real estate
sector in St Petersburg as well as Moscow but in the end TRUMP had had
to settle for the use of extensive sexual services there from local
prostitutes rather than business success.

#### RUSSIA: SECRET KREMLIN MEETINGS ATTENDED BY TRUMP ADVISOR,
#### CARTER PAGE IN MOSCOW (JULY 2016)

#### Summary

TRUMP advisor Carter PAGE holds secret meetings in Moscow with
SECHIN and senior Kremlin Internal Affairs official, DIVYEKIN

SECHIN raises issues of future bilateral US-Russia energy co-operation
and associated lifting of western sanctions against Russia over Ukraine.
PAGE non-committal in response

DIVEYKIN discusses release of Russian dossier of'kompromat" on
TRUMP's opponent, Hillary CLINTON, but also hints at Kremlin
possession of such material on TRUMP

#### Detail

Speaking in July 2016, a Russian source close to Rosneft President, PUTIN
close associate and US-sanctioned individual, Igor SECHIN, confided the
details of a recent secret meeting between him and visiting Foreign
Affairs Advisor to Republican presidential candidate Donald TRUMP,
Carter PAGE.

According to SECHIN's associate, the Rosneft President (CEO) had raised
with PAGE the issues of future bilateral energy cooperation and
prospects for an associated move to lift Ukraine-related western
sanctions against Russia. PAGE had reacted positively to this demarche
by SECHIN but had been generally non-committal in response.

Speaking separately, also in July 2016, an official close to Presidential
Administration Head, S. IVANOV, confided in a compatriot that a senior
colleague in the Internal Political Department of the PA, DIVYEKIN (nfd)
also had met secretly with PAGE on his recent visit. Their agenda had
included DIVEYKIN raising a dossier of 'kompromat' the Kremlin
possessed on TRUMP's Democratic presidential rival, Hillary CLINTON,
and its possible release to the Republican's campaign team.

However, the Kremlin official close to S. IVANOV added that s/he believed
DIVEYKIN also had hinted (or indicated more strongly) that the Russian
leadership also had 'kompromat' on TRUMP which the latter should bear
in mind in his dealings with them.

#### RUSSIA-US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION: KREMLIN CONCERN THAT POLITICAL FALLOUT FROM
#### DNC E-MAIL HACKING AFFAIR SPIRALLING OUT OF CONTROL

#### Summary

Kremlin concerned that political fallout from DNC e-mail hacking operation is spiralling
out of control. Extreme nervousness among TRUMP's associates as result of negative
media attention/accusations

Russians meanwhile keen to cool situation and maintain 'plausible deniability' of
existing/ongoing pro-TRUMP and anti-CLINTON operations. Therefore unlikely to be
any ratcheting up offensive plays in immediate future

Source close to TRUMP campaign however confirms regular exchange with Kremlin
has existed for at least 8 years, including intelligence fed back to Russia on 
oligarchs' activities in US

Russians apparently have promised not to use 'kompromat' they hold on TRUMP as
leverage, given high levels of voluntary co-operation forthcoming from his team

#### Detail

Speaking in confidence to a trusted associate in late July 2016, a Russian emigre figure
close to the Republican US presidential candidate Donald TRUMP's campaign team
commented on the fallout from publicity surrounding the Democratic National
Committee (DNC) e-mail hacking scandal. The emigre said there was a high level of
anxiety within the TRUMP team as a result of various accusations levelled against
them and indications from the Kremlin that President PUTIN and others in the
leadership thought things had gone too far now and risked spiralling out of control.

Continuing on this theme, the emigre associate of TRUMP opined that the Kremlin
wanted the situation to calm but for 'plausible deniability' to be maintained
concerning its (extensive) pro-TRUMP and anti-CLINTON operations. S/he therefore
judged that it was unlikely these would be ratcheted up, at least for the time being.

However, in terms of established operational liaison between the TRUMP team and
the Kremlin, the emigre confirmed that an intelligence exchange had been running
between them for at least 8 years. Within this context PUTIN's priority requirement
had been for intelligence on the activities, business and otherwise, in the US of leading
Russian oligarchs and their families. TRUMP and his associates duly had obtained and
supplied the Kremlin with this information.


###### PAGE 12, 30 July 2016


Finally, the emigre said s/he understood the Kremlin had more intelligence on
CLINTON and her campaign but he did not know the details or when or if it would be
released. As far as 'kompromat' (compromising information) on TRUMP were
concerned, although there was plenty of this, he understood the Kremlin had given its
word that it would not be deployed against the Republican presidential candidate
given how helpful and co-operative his team had been over several years, and
particularly of late.

#### GROWING BACKLASH IN KREMLIN TO DNC HACKING AND
#### TRUMP SUPPORT OPERATIONS

#### Summary

Head of PA IVANOV laments Russian intervention in US presidential
election and black PR against CLINTON and the DNC. Vows not to supply
intelligence to Kremlin PR operatives again. Advocates now sitting tight
and denying everything

Presidential spokesman PESKOV the main protagonist in Kremlin
campaign to aid TRUMP and damage CLINTON. He is now scared and
fears being made scapegoat by leadership for backlash in US. Problem
compounded by his botched intervention in recent Turkish crisis

Premier MEDVEDEV's office furious over DNC hacking and associated
anti-Russian publicity. Want good relations with US and ability to travel
there. Refusing to support or help cover up after PESKOV

Talk now in Kremlin withdrawing from presidential race
altogether, but this still largely wishful thinking by more liberal elements
in Moscow

#### Detail

Speaking in early August 2016, two well-placed and established Kremlin
sources outlined the divisions and backlash in Moscow arising from the
leaking of Democratic National Committee (DNC) e-mails and the wider
pro-TRUMP operation being conducted in the US. Head of Presidential
Administration, Sergei IVANOV, was angry at the recent turn of events.
He believed the Kremlin "team" involved, led by presidential spokesman
Dmitriy PESKOV, had gone too far in interfering in foreign affairs with
their "elephant in a china shop black PR". IVANOV claimed always to have
opposed the handling and exploitation of intelligence by this PR "team".
Following the backlash against such foreign interference in US politics,
IVANOV was advocating that the only sensible course of action now for
the Russian leadership was to "sit tight and deny everything".

Continuing on this theme the source close to IVANOV reported that
PESKOV now was "scared shitless" that he would be scapegoated by
PUTIN and the Kremlin and held responsible for the backlash against
Russian political interference in the US election. IVANOV was determined


###### PAGE 14, 5 AUGUST 2016


to stop PESKOV playing an independent role in relation to the US going
forward and the source fully expected the presidential spokesman now to
lay low. PESKOV's position was not helped by a botched attempt by him
also to interfere in the recent failed coup in Turkey from a government
relations (GR) perspective (no further details).

The extent of disquiet and division within Moscow caused by the
backlash against Russian interference in the US election was underlined
by a second source, close to premier Dmitriy MEDVEDEV (DAM). S/he
said the Russian prime minister and his colleagues wanted to have good
relations with the US, regardless of who was in power there, and not least
so as to be able to travel there in future, either officially or privately. They
were openly refusing to cover up for PESKOV and others involved in the
operations or to support his counter-attack of allegations
against the USG for its alleged hacking ofthe Russian government and
state agencies.

According to the first source, close to IVANOV, there had been talk in the
Kremlin of TRUMP being forced to withdraw from the presidential race
altogether as a result of recent events, ostensibly on grounds of his
state and unsuitability for high office. This might not be so
bad for Russia in the circumstances but in the view of the source, it
remained largely wishful thinking on the part ofthose in the regime
opposed to PESKOV and his "botched" operations, at least for the time
being.

#### PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION: SENIOR KREMLIN FIGURE OUTLINES EVOLVING RUSSIAN TACTICS IN
#### PRO-TRUMP, ANTI-CLINTON OPERATION

#### Summary

Head of PA, IVANOV assesses Kremlin intervention in US presidential election and outlines leadership
thinking on operational way forward

No new leaks envisaged, as too politically risky, but rather further exploitation of (WikiLeaks) material
already disseminated to exacerbate divisions

Educated US youth to be targeted as protest (against CLINTON) and swing vote in attempt to turn them
over to TRUMP

Russian leadership, including PUTIN, celebrating perceived success to date in splitting US hawks and
elite

Kremlin engaging with several high profile US players, including STEIN, PAGE and (former DIA Director
Michael Flynn), and funding their recent visits to Moscow

#### Details

Speaking in confidence to a close colleague in early August 2016, Head of the Russian Presidential
Administration (PA), Sergei IVANOV, assessed the impact and results of Kremlin intervention in the US
presidential election to date. Although most commentators believed that the Kremlin was behind the
leaked DNC/CLINTON e-mails, this remained technically deniable. Therefore the Russians would not
risk their position for the time being with new leaked material, even to a third party like WikiLeaks.
Rather the tactics would be to spread rumours and misinformation about the content of what already
had been leaked and make up new content.

Continuing on this theme, IVANOV said that the audience to be targeted by such operations was the
educated youth in America as the PA assessed that there was still a chance they could be persuaded to
vote for Republican candidate Donald TRUMP as a protest against the Washington establishment (in
the form of Democratic candidate Hillary CLINTON). The hope was that even if she won, as a result of
this CLINTON in power would be bogged down in working for internal reconciliation in the US, rather
than being able to focus on foreign policy which would damage Russia's interests. This also should give
President PUTIN more room for manoeuvre in the run-up to Russia's own presidential election in 2018.

IVANOV reported that although the Kremlin had underestimated the strength of US media and liberal
reaction to the DNC hack and TRUMP's links to Russia, PUTIN was generally satisfied with the progress
of the anti-CLINTON operation to date. He recently had had a drink with PUTIN to mark this. In 
IVANOV's view, the US had tried to divide the Russian elite with sanctions but failed, whilst they, by contrast, had
succeeded in splitting the US hawks inimical to Russia and the Washington elite more generally, half of
whom had refused to endorse any presidential candidate as a result of Russian intervention.

Speaking separately, also in early August 2016, a Kremlin official involved in US relations commented
on aspects of the Russian operation to date. Its goals had been threefold- asking sympathetic US actors
how Moscow could help them; gathering relevant intelligence; and creating and disseminating
compromising information ('kompromat'). This had involved the Kremlin supporting various US political
figures, including funding indirectly their recent visits to Moscow. S/he named a delegation from
Lyndon LAROUCHE; presidential candidate Jill STEIN of the Green Party; TRUMP foreign policy adviser

perceived outcomes.

#### RUSSIA/US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION: REACTION IN TRUMP CAMP TO RECENT NEGATIVE PUBLICITY ABOUT
#### RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE AND LIKELY RESULTING TACTICS GOING FORWARD

#### Summary

TRUMP campaign insider reports recent DNC e-mail leaks were aimed at switching SANDERS (protest)
voters away from CLINTON and over to TRUMP

Admits Republican campaign underestimated resulting negative reaction from US liberals, elite and
media and forced to change course as result

Need now to turn tables on use of PUTIN as bogeyman in election, although some
resentment at Russian president's perceived attempt to undermine USG and system over and above
swinging presidential election

#### Detail

Speaking in confidence on 9 August 2016, an ethnic Russian associate of Republican US presidential
candidate Donald TRUMP discussed the reaction inside his camp, and revised tactics therein resulting
from recent negative publicity concerning Moscow's clandestine involvement in the campaign.
TRUMP's associate reported that the aim of leaking the DNC e-mails to WikiLeaks during the Democratic
Convention had been to swing supporters of Bernie SANDERS away from Hillary CLINTON and across to
TRUMP. These voters were perceived as activist and anti-status quo and anti-establishmentand in that
regard sharing many features with the TRUMP campaign, including a visceral dislike of Hillary CLINTON.
This objective had been conceived and promoted, inter alia, by TRUMP's foreign policy adviser Carter
PAGE who had discussed itdirectly with the ethnic Russian associate.

Continuing on this theme, the ethnic Russian associate of TRUMP assessed that the problem was that
the TRUMP campaign had underestimated the strength of the negative reaction from liberals and
especially the conservative elite to Russian interference. This was forcinga rethink and a likely change
of tactics. The main objective in the short term was to check Democratic candidate Hillary CLINTON's
successful exploitation of the PUTIN as bogeyman/Russian interference story to tarnish TRUMP and
bolster her own (patriotic) credentials.The TRUMP campaign was focusing on tapping into support in
the American television media to achieve this, as they reckoned this resource had been underused by
them to date.

However, TRUMP's associate also admitted that there was a fair amount of anger and resentment
within the Republican candidate's team at what was perceived by PUTIN as going beyond the objective
of weakening CLINTON and bolstering TRUMP, by attempting to exploit the situation to undermine the
US government and democratic system more generally. It was unclear at present how this aspect of
the situation would play out inthe weeks to come.
