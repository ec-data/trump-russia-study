#### MUSING ON REPORTS


Many portions are written as 'heard through the grapevine' rumors, 
not likely to all be true - but some of it should be confirmable.

Dates related to Carter Page, Flynn, and Cohen visits overseas should be
confirmable. Jill Stein as well though maybe unrelated.

Cohen claims he did not visit Prague, but Italy (with a picture of his closed passport, why do that?). 
Coincidentally these are both 'Schengen area' EU members which allow free travel 
between themselves - around a one hour flight actually with no passport stamp, or much longer by train. 
Report states Russia wanted to meet in 'operationally soft' EU countries to not add to growing 
concerns about Trump team member visits to Russia.

Who is/was the ethnic Russian individual (and source) involved in the Trump campaign?

What is the exact meaning of 'ethnic' Russian with respect to the Queen's English?

Trump has had business dealings with Russian oligarchs in the US, and he was asked to
provide information on them to Putin/FSB. We should be able to build a reasonable list. 

Correlate dates of intelligence reports with activity in campaign, note churn
especially with Manafort et al. in August. The reports state stress in the Kremlin was
also building due to known Russian involvement by IC - change of direction was 
recommended to Trump campaign and Ivanov's 'black PR' team.

The report estimates Trump's dealings with Russia in regards to campaign
go back 5-8 years, we can take a look at timeline leading up to campaign starting
in 2008.

Confirm timeline of Kremlin intelligence with Obama sending
home the Russian diplomats in December. Compile list of names.
