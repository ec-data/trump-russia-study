#### MUSING ON REPORTS


Many portions are written as 'heard through the grapevine' rumors, 
not likely to all be true - but some of it should be confirmable.

Dates related to Carter Page, Flynn, and Cohen visits overseas should be
confirmable. Jill Stein as well though maybe unrelated.

Cohen claims he did not visit Prague, but Italy in Summer 2016 
(with a picture of his closed passport, why do that?). 
Coincidentally these are both 'Schengen area' EU members which allow free travel 
between themselves - around a one hour flight actually with no passport stamp, or much longer by train. 
Report states Russia wanted to meet in 'operationally soft' EU countries to not add to growing 
concerns about Trump team member visits to Russia. There are no specific dates claimed but
a general August 2016.

Who is/was the ethnic Russian individual (and dossier source) close to the Trump campaign?

Trump has had business dealings with Russian oligarchs in the US, and he was asked to
provide information on them to Putin/FSB. We should be able to build a reasonable list. 

Correlate dates of intelligence reports with activity in campaign, note churn
especially with Manafort et al. in August. The reports state stress in the Kremlin was
also building due to known Russian involvement by IC - change of direction was 
recommended to Trump campaign and Ivanov's 'black PR' team.

The report estimates Trump's dealings with Russia in regards to campaign
go back 5-8 years, we can take a look at timeline leading up to campaign starting
in 2008.

Confirm timeline of Kremlin intelligence with Obama sending
home the Russian diplomats in December. Compile list of names.


#### LIKELY RELATED OR OF INTEREST


Carter Page (Gazprom lobbyist) relationship to Jeff Sessions, specifically on 
Russian assignment, and Jeff Sessions placement as Attorney General

Trump denied any connections with Carter Page (who appeared as Foreign Policy Advisor
on campaign documents, was present at various rallies)

Ongoing (Feb 2017, see leaked doc) counterintelligence operation against 
Carter Page and leaked communication/rants. He shows mental unraveling in similar
fashion to Flynn and son (even the consistent attachment to conspiracy theories)

Interesting individuals on Sessions' lead foreign advisory team: 
George Papadopoulos (Advisor focused on natural gas in East-Mediterranean/Caspian region), 
Carter Page (Gazprom lobbyist, close relationship with Russian energy sector), 
Joseph Schmitz (Lawyer, Blackwater, disgraced former Inspector General), 
Walid Phares (Lebanese, counter-terrorism advisor, ties to militant Christian groups, Fifth Bureau) 
Stephen Miller (White nationalist, contemporary of Richard Spencer, speaker and speech writer for Trump)

Rosneft deals (19.5% to state-owned Qatar Investment Authority (QIA)) go ahead 
immediately following Trump election victory

Recent U.S sanctions on Russia affected Rosneft/ExxonMobil joint operations in Arctic drilling

Placement of ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State

Rex Tillerson relationship with Igor Sechin (Rosneft CEO) and other Kremlin officials

Richard Burt lobbyist activity for Russian pipeline while simultaneously advising 
Trump for April 2016 speech (Burt also has history with Jeff Sessions)

State-owned Qatar Airways (QA) had rented 'corporate campus' from Trump for years

QA has been involved in failed lobbying attempts recently and accused of undercutting
American companies using massive subsidies from Persian Gulf countries. US corporations
claim this violates the 'Open Skies Agreement'.

Relationship with Akbar al-Baker (CEO Qatar Airways)

Relationship with Hussain Sajwani and associates

Large payments received by Manafort (~12M) for aiding Russian coup 
activity in Ukraine (Yanukovych and more)

Manafort involvement with Ukrainian corporate asset transfer to Russian oligarchs

Yanukovych campaign strategy claiming 'election fraud' and calls for 'election observers'

Many (nearly all?) Russian oligarchs in the US have property dealings in Florida or New York

Possible Russian/Soviet emigres/executives targeted by the proposed Putin-Trump information trade:
    Dmitry Rybolovlev,
    Felix Sater,
    Tevfik Arif,
    Various other Bayrock/FL Group employees and criminal connections,
    Tamir Sapir,
    Alex Sapir,
    Mikhail Lesin,
    Roman Abramovich,
    Darya Zhukova,
    Igor Krutoy

Hidden Russian assets exposed by the Panama leaks should be reviewed and cross-referenced
with other leaks and companies highlighted by the dossier

Trump lawyer and family members/associates are extremely active on various social media sites, 
trip to Greece/Italy (Nerano, Capri, Spetses, Skiathos, Malta) easily found through timestamp/EXIF data
with photos in late July 2016.

Roger Stone admitted 'back-channel' (a 'mutual American friend' of Assange) communication 
with WikiLeaks, which would make sense given he tweeted innuendo about leaks weeks
before they actually happened. Did WikiLeaks corroborate this? Seems strange that 
any WikiLeaks affiliate would willingly interact with such an individual. Assange could
be asked to comment.

It is easy to think WikiLeaks is impartial, simply releasing information as it is provided,
but keep in mind Assange has ties to Russia including a show on RT (state-owned news/propaganda machine)

Assange contradictory public statements on Panama Papers (questioning the source 
using 'Soros boogeyman' instead of the actual information, which is 
entirely opposite of WikiLeak's typical stance)

Can go back and review earlier major WikiLeaks postings (diplomatic cables, Palin emails, TPP, etc) 
to determine if this has been a running theme at the organization. They have certainly
disproportionally attacked Western targets/allies, but that may be attributed to these nations
being much softer with information/whistleblowers than the authoritarian states. 
Citizens of modern liberal democracies are also much more likely to consider leaks as 
patriotic activity - especially after the vast surveillance apparatus exposed by Snowden.

Trump has been accused (Financial Times researchers and others) of being 'bailed out' by Russian 
sources (including criminal fronts) in a period of multiple bankruptcies in 2000s. 
Trump Jr statement from this era: 'money is pouring in from Russia'. If there is any truth to 
this then Sergei Millian would be the gatekeeper (or Trump's full financial records, 
which he refuses to release).

'Tea Leaves' investigator reports odd DNS requests suggesting communication
between Trump tower server and two Russian Alfa Bank servers - as well as Spectrum Health 
servers oddly enough. Server is shutdown shortly after the report. 
Later realized Devos husband (huge political donor) is on the board at Spectrum Health.

Devos also operates Alticor and Amway (blatant pyramid scheme). Amway operates in
Russia and works with Alfa Bank. 'Alfa-Amway Program for Individual Business Owners'

Trump server leak is very hard to prove without knowing who Tea Leaves works for, though it is
true that security researchers are given access to DNS datasets to track major hacks/attacks. 
More interesting would be to run analysis on the packets themselves and compare to 
known secure communication methods (fingerprinting works on many forms of encryption
currently in use, especially considering the low-tech approach in using this server) - 
NSA likely already doing or did this.

Another question on Tea Leaves leak: why would a DNS translation be involved at all - 
skipping the middle man and using a (static) IP address would be obvious to any admin.
More obvious would be to use a few hops instead of blatant direct connections and
Trump owned domains.
Many challenges on this one, though the raw data is certainly interesting. See graph
provided in images for an overview.

Claims that the server was rebooted under a different domain name and immediately
contacted Alfa Bank. 'trump-email.com' to ''

#### DEAD / MISSING / ARRESTED AFTER LEAK


Oleg Erovinkin, widely discussed online as possible Sechin mole shortly before his death

Kaspersky and FSB ISC arrests: Sergey Mikhaylov, Ruslan Stoyanov for "treason:
accepting payment to provide evidence on DNC hacking"

Steele and close family are still missing (assumed to be in hiding)


#### TRUMP CAMPAIGN ROOTS


Priebus takes over RNC chair in January 2011

ShouldTrumpRun.com (Cohen, Stewart Rahr) in 2011/2012, legal issues with FEC

DraftTrump2012.com (Roger Stone, who has extensive history of corruption) in 2011

Time reporting on campaign possiblity and Trump talks with Priebus in early April 2011

Trump 'birtherism' political campaign starts in early 2011

Birtherism as a political strategy likely the result of think tank / opposition
research as far back as the 2008 campaigns. Clinton and McCain both reported to
reject this strategy in articles from that period. It was used by others in 
massive fundraising campaigns circa 2009 - coinciding and directly related to the 
beginnings of the 'Tea Party' nationalist movement.
